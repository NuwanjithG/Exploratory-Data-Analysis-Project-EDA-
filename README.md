# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project-EDA-
This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Python Pandas. The project focuses on analyzing marathon race data sourced from Kaggle, utilizing Jupyter Notebook for coding.

# Overview
The dataset used in this project comprises approximately 7 million records of marathon race data spanning from 1798 to 2022. The primary objective of the analysis is to perform EDA to gain insights into marathon races, particularly focusing on races held in the USA in the year 2020.

# Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. You can find the dataset here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633

# Python Libraries Used
* Pandas
* Seaborn

# Project Details
1. Data Cleaning: The initial step involves cleaning up the dataset to prepare it for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
2. Data Analysis: The focus of the analysis is on marathon races that took place in the USA in the year 2020. Various aspects of the race data are explored, including participant demographics, race distances, race locations, and race timings.
3. Visualization: The insights derived from the data analysis are visually represented using Seaborn and other visualization libraries. This includes creating plots, charts, and graphs to effectively communicate the findings.
4. Conclusion: The project concludes with a summary of key insights and observations obtained from the EDA process.

# Usage
To run the Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for this analysis, simply download the ipynb file and open it in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own analysis projects!

Note: This project is solely for educational and demonstration purposes.
